# Mongo API Project

First project using Mongoose to model data and seed to database.

# The problem

The assignment was to create a database and learn how to seed data to the database. I used different routes, parameters and querys to sort and present the data. I wanted a challenge so I also added querys to filter the data by pages since it was a lot of information in the json. I also created a frontend to my database to better understand how to structure the data in the database.
